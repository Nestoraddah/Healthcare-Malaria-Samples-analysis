# Healthcare-Malaria-Samples-analysis
Analysed a malaria sample dataset to answer healthcare questions
This project analyzed malaria survey data collected from hospitals across Ghana to uncover demographic and regional trends in malaria infections. Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib), the dataset was cleaned by removing duplicates, handling missing values (e.g., imputing literacy levels), and restructuring columns for consistency. The analysis explored patterns in sample types, age distribution, gender, and regional results to understand malaria prevalence.

Key analytical steps included:

Data preprocessing: cleaning duplicates, correcting missing data, and reformatting names.

Exploratory analysis: summarizing hospital participation, literacy levels, and sample distributions.

Statistical insights: identifying the most common sample type, average age of patients, and age groups with the highest malaria positivity rates.

Visualization: creating bar plots to represent infection distribution across demographics.

Research Questions Answered

What is the most common sample type used for malaria testing across regions?

What is the average age of individuals tested for malaria?

Which age group shows the highest rate of positive malaria results?

Are there notable differences in infection rates across genders or regions?

How does literacy level correlate with malaria occurrence (using imputed data)?

Outcome

The analysis provided actionable insights into malaria trends, supporting healthcare decision-making and regional resource allocation. It demonstrates proficiency in data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using Python for health data analytics.
